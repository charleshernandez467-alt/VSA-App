**# Mockup Design - Interactive Dashboard**



**## Description**



**Project by: Emilio Betanzos**  

**Teacher: Christelle Navarrete**  





This project involves the design of an interactive **dashboard** to visualize it with Streamlit and Github. The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs), filters, and charts based on the dataset provided. The goal was to build a simple yet functional dashboard to explore various data insights.





**## Project Overview**



1\. \*\*Dashboard Creation\*\*: The interactive dashboard was built to allow users to explore synthetic course enrollment data, displaying KPIs like total students, average satisfaction, and students per course.

&nbsp;  

2\. \*\*Data and Visualizations\*\*: Although we were initially planning to use real data from the \*\*Mexico City Attorney General's Office (FGJCDMX)\*\*, we opted for synthetic data due to confidentiality concerns. This allows the app to demonstrate functionality without compromising any sensitive information.



3\. **Features**:

\## Files Used



The following files were used to build the project:



1\. streamlit\_app\_.py: The main script for the dashboard, which contains the logic for filtering, displaying KPIs, and generating the charts.

2\. config.toml`: Configuration file used to style the app, including color schemes and font choices.

3\. Requierment.txt: Text extensión allow the GitHub download the correct dependencies in order to streamlit correctly the dashboard. 

4\. gitignore. : Text extensión that ignores some specific type of archives. 

5\. Future Archives Integration: On future projects we'll be able to manage confidential data, so do "carpeta\_FGJ\_acumulado\_01.py"



&nbsp;  -Note: This CSV was not used due to its **confidential nature**. Instead, a synthetic dataset was generated to mimic the structure of the actual data, ensuring the functionality and interactivity of the dashboard without compromising sensitive information.
